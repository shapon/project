CREATING MICROSERVICE USING SPRING CLOUD, EUREKA AND ZUUL
Spring framework provides set of libraries for creating microservices in Java. They are a part of Spring Cloud project. Today I’m going to show you how to create simple microservices using Spring Boot and following technologies:

Zuul –  gateway service that provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, security, and more
Ribbon – client side load balancer
Feign – declarative REST client
Eureka – service registration and discovery
Sleuth – distributed tracing via logs
Zipkin – distributed tracing system with request visualization.
